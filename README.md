# Intro to R Tutorials 

This repository contains [*learnr*](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) tutorials introducing R and basic statistics concepts through exercises with simulated data and multiple-choice quizzes. They were used to get medical students acquainted with R in **Modul 28: Einblicke in die Praxis der empirischen neurowissenschaftlich-psychiatrischen Forschung (Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, DE)**. All tutorials can be completely self-driven and were last updated in the summer term of 2023. 

### Base tutorial
The **_Intro to R_** tutorial introduces basic R concepts (environment, variables, data frames, libraries etc), as well as Pearson's correlation and the independent t-test. This tutorial was the basis of the course. 

### Optional tutorials
There were three optional tutorials for students who might be interested in further topics:
- **_Parametric Assumptions_**: introduces parametric assumptions, how and why to check them, and non-parametric alternatives to Pearson's correlation and the independent t-test.
- **_Statistical Tests as LMs_**: introduces the concept of common statistical tests as linear models, exemplified through Pearson's correlation and Student's t-test.
- **_Comparing Several Variables_**: introduces one-way independent ANOVA.
